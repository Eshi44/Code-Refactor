# Code-Refactor
An existing webpage was refactored  to make it more accessible, efficient, and organized. 
The css.style sheet was ordered by grouping elements, classes, ect. 
In addition, CSS selectors and properties were consolidated. 
HTML semantic elements were also added to enhance SEO as well as to organize the html file and replace <div> tags. 
All images, including the background image and emoji, were given alt attributes or aria-label attributes to make the page more accessible.
Minor aesthetic changes were made, such as making all the fonts and colors the same.
